This is a UCSD DSC80 project. 

# Introduction
Hi! My name is Isabela de la Cruz, for this project I chose to explore the "Recipes and Ratings" dataset. The Recipes dataset has 83,782 rows and stores the following columns: name of the recipe, its id, time it takes to make in minutes, contributor id, date it was submitted, nutrition, steps, description, ingredients, and number of igredients. The Ratings dataset has 731,927 and stores the following columns: user id, recipe id, date, rating, and review. 

With these datasets I want to answer this question, "What factors influence how well a recipe is rated? More specifically, what characteristics are associated with high ratings and what characteristics tend to lower ratings" 

Online recipe platforms are home to thousands of user submitted recipes each with various prepreation time, ingredients and difficult levels. Understanding what makes a recipe highly rated can help home cooks identify better recipes, and help cooks submit popular recipes.
